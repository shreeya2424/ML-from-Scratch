# ML-from-Scratch
### Building ML models from scratch
This repository contains Python code to implement various machine learning models from scratch. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms work by building them from the ground up, without relying on pre-built libraries like Scikit-learn.
